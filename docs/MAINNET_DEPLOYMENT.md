# Stargate Soroban Mainnet Deployment

Mainnet deployment must not run from a single local shell. The checked-in `scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh` intentionally refuses to deploy because live deployment requires governance approval, multi-sig signing, and a recorded signing ceremony.

## Preconditions

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test`
- WASM artifacts built with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
- Admin, treasury, and compliance keys confirmed on Stellar mainnet.
- AWS KMS or approved signing service configured for production signing.
- Production USDC asset issuer verified against official Circle/Stellar documentation.
- Mainnet Horizon and Soroban RPC health checks passing.

## Ceremony

1. Open a deployment issue with target commit SHA, expected WASM hashes, admins, and treasury signers.
2. Collect required multi-sig approvals.
3. Build release artifacts from a clean checkout.
4. Verify WASM hashes match the deployment issue.
5. Submit deployment transactions through the approved signer.
6. Record transaction hashes and deployed contract IDs.
7. Update backend production secrets with:
   - `INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID`
   - `TREASURY_CONTRACT_ID`
   - `COMPLIANCE_CONTRACT_ID`
8. Run backend `GET /health/rpc` and a low-value end-to-end invoice payment.

## Abort Conditions

- Any signer mismatch.
- Any WASM hash mismatch.
- Soroban RPC health degraded across all configured endpoints.
- Any failed low-value payment smoke test.
